This is a modification kit for the Wolverine telecine machine. The kit is based on a new controller board and a new camera. It is designed to replace the stock Wolverine controller with much improved video quality.
The controller and camera shipped by Wolverine captures the 8mm movie as an MP4 stream and very little control is given to the user. Most common complaint is high compression and digital effects that can be very bothersome to some users. 
This new board can be combined with the camera (camera not included) and lens that captures the movie as a sequence of images into the laptop and it allows the user full control of image and stream parameters.  
The board is an open design. The hardware design is available here in this repositiry and the firmware for teh MSP430 controller is available in the MSP folder. Refer to the user manaul included here for details.
