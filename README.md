This is a modification kit for the Wolverine Moviemaker Pro telecine machine.  
The kit is based on a new controller board and a new camera.  
Camera used:  
https://www.theimagingsource.com/en-us/product/board/2u/dfm72buc02ml/  
It is designed to replace the stock Wolverine controller with much improved video quality.  
The controller and camera shipped by Wolverine captures the 8mm movie as an MP4 stream and very little control is given to the user.  
Most common complaint is high compression and digital effects that can be very bothersome to some users.   
This new board can be combined with the camera and lens that captures the video as a sequence of images   
into the laptop and it allows the user full control of image and stream parameters.
